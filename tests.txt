Problem: optimization of porcelain utensils production


Problem Description:
Suppose you have a porcelain factory that produces various types of tableware such as plates, mugs, and teapots. You have a limited amount of resources such as ceramics, labor, and time, and you want to maximize profits by producing a certain amount of each type of tableware. Each piece of utensil requires a specific amount of ceramics and time to produce, and produces a certain profit.


Task: 
Formulate this problem as a linear programming problem and use the simplex method to optimize the production of tableware to maximize profit subject to resource constraints.




Test 1:
# Ceramics, time and profit coefficients for each piece of tableware, respectively plates, mugs and teapots
ceramics_coefficients = [2, 1, 3]
time_coefficients = [1, 2, 2] 
profit_coefficients = [5, 3, 4] 


# The available amount of ceramics and time
ceramics_constraint = 6
time_constraint = 8


# Expected results of optimization
expected_profit = 22  # Expected maximum profit
expected_plates = 4  # Expected number of plates
expected_mugs = 0  # Expected number of mugs
expected_teapots = 2  # Expected number of teapots


Test 2:
# Ceramics, time and profit coefficients for each piece of tableware, respectively plates, mugs and teapots
ceramics_coefficients = [3, 2, 2] 
time_coefficients = [2, 1, 3]  
profit_coefficients = [4, 2, 5] 


# The available amount of ceramics and time
ceramics_constraint = 10
time_constraint = 12


# Expected results of optimization
expected_profit = 26
expected_plates = 2
expected_mugs = 4
expected_teapots = 2


Test 3:
# Ceramics, time and profit coefficients for each piece of tableware, respectively plates, mugs and teapots
ceramics_coefficients = [2, 2, 1]
time_coefficients = [3, 1, 2] 
profit_coefficients = [6, 4, 3] 


# The available amount of ceramics and time
ceramics_constraint = 9
time_constraint = 8


# Expected results of optimization
expected_profit = 32
expected_plates = 2
expected_mugs = 6
expected_teapots = 0


Test 4:
# Ceramics, time and profit coefficients for each piece of tableware, respectively plates, mugs and teapots
ceramics_coefficients = [1, 3, 2]  
time_coefficients = [2, 2, 1] 
profit_coefficients = [3, 5, 4] 


# The available amount of ceramics and time
ceramics_constraint = 7
time_constraint = 9


# Expected results of optimization
expected_profit = 16
expected_plates = 3
expected_mugs = 1
expected_teapots = 0


Test 5:
