Problem: optimization of porcelain utensils production

Problem Description: Suppose you have a porcelain factory that produces various types of tableware such as plates, mugs, and teapots. You have a limited amount of resources such as ceramics, labor, and time, and you want to maximize profits by producing a certain amount of each type of tableware. Each piece of utensil requires a specific amount of ceramics and time to produce, and produces a certain profit.

Task: Formulate this problem as a linear programming problem and use the simplex method to optimize the production of tableware to maximize profit subject to resource constraints.
